DESCRIPTION & REQUIREMENTS

The [Macosko lab](https://macoskolab.com/) is seeking a computational associate to join our team at the Broad to tackle neurodegenerative disease at the intersection of the brain and immune system. For example, we are constructing large datasets of single-cell gene expression profiles from hundreds of brains from living subjects affected by Alzheimer's disease, along with whole genome sequencing, proteomics data from paired CSF and blood samples. The selected candidate will assist our efforts to integrate datasets and collaborate with industry partners to identify new disease biomarkers and uncover cellular processes that drive the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.

The ideal candidate will have a very strong quantitative background (computer science, statistics, applied mathematics, or physics) and understanding of biology. 

 - Collaborate with experimentalists and computational biologists to develop and apply statistical and computational techniques on large-scale single-cell datasets to identify biologically meaningful changes in specific cell types.

 - Collaborate with other Broad computational biologists to perform integration of other modalities of data, including proteomics, genetics, and clinical biomarkers, with the goal of target identification and patient stratification.

 - Create scientifically rigorous visualizations and clearly communicate findings both in writing and through the presentation of results.

 - Contribute to the generation of code repositories, publications, and intellectual property.

 - Maintain and organize computational infrastructure and resources.
