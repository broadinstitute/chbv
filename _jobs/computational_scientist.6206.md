The Macosko Lab is seeking a computational biologist to work with data from a new spatial genomics technology we have developed called Slide-tags (soon-to-be-published), which allows thousands of single cells to be spatially localized while simultaneously measuring their gene expression and chromatin accessibility. We are deploying Slide-tags to large numbers of human brain specimens to study variation in cell types across both normal individuals, as well as those with neurodegenerative disease.

The candidate should have experience with high dimensional data analysis, and a strong knowledge of statistics. Experience working with human genetics data is ideal. Our lab is a vibrant, interdisciplinary group committed to joining together to solve hard problems. We welcome applicants who share our passion for using new technology to make new, meaningful insights into the function of the brain and its dysfunction in disease. 

WE ARE LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WHO:

- Has a Ph.D. and 2-4 yearsâ€™ experience in Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Mathematics, Biology, Statistics or a related quantitative discipline

- Demonstrated experience designing computational methods and tools, including prior experience with algorithms relevant to single-cell RNA-Seq and/or spatial analysis 

- Prior knowledge of neuroscience and/or neuropsychiatric disease biology is preferred but not required.

- Demonstrated proficiency with coding in Python, Matlab, Unix/Linux, Java, C++,  or R.

- Familiarity with a range of sequence alignment tools, ideally those used for RNA-Seq (TopHat, STAR, RSEM, etc.), is a plus

- Excellent communication, organization, and time management skills

- Cares passionately about the quality of his/her work and demonstrates zealous attention to detail

- All Computational Scientists at Broad are encouraged to continue their technical growth by engaging with the wider computational community through Broad's vibrant [Models, Inference & Algorithms Initiative](broadinstitute.org/mia).
