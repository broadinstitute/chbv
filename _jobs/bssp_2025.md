In collaboration with the Broad Summer Scholars Program (BSSP), we invite highly motivated **high school students** with a strong interest in science to conduct a 6 week paid summer internship at the Broad Institute. In addition to original research, students will explore scientific careers; attend scientific talks; present their research to the Broad community in a scientific poster session; attend a college fair; participate in fun social events; and meet other students who share similar interests.

We especially encourage applications from students who meet one or more of the following criteria:
- Underrepresented in the sciencesâ€”these groups include Native Americans or Alaska Natives, Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinxs, Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific Islanders, as well as individuals with disabilities.
- Underserved, as indicated by qualifying for free or reduced lunch.
- Could be the first person in their family to attend college.
- Demonstrate a commitment to issues of diversity and inclusion through extracurricular and/or community activities that address social, educational, or economic disparities in the United States.
