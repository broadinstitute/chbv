In collaboration with the Broad Summer Research Program (BSRP), we invite exceptional **undergraduates** interested in pursuing graduate school (PhD or MD-PhD) to apply for a 9 week paid summer internship at the Broad Institute. Students spend the summer performing original computational or experimental-based research. At the program's conclusion, students give oral and poster presentations on their research projects. BSRP features a rich curriculum that emphasizes communication, collaborative problem-solving, graduate school preparation, and demystifying scientific careers.

The program is open to students with a demonstrated commitment to promoting diversity and inclusion in STEM disciplines. Students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences are especially encouraged to apply.
