 Riyaan is an undergraduate co-op researcher at the Center for Human Brain Variation. He is currently finishing his 4th year as a behavioral neuroscience major at Northeastern University and is looking to pursue an MD-PhD post-undergrad. Before working at the Broad, Riyaan worked at the Harvard Medical School Department of Neurobiology in the Regehr Lab where he conducted stereotaxic surgeries to study the cytoarchitecture of the cerebellum in mouse models. Riyaan maintains a strong interest in continuing his studies of the brain in the hopes of bridging the gap between neurobiology and  treatments for neurological disorders.
