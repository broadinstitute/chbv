 Julianna is a Research Associate I at the Center for Human Brain Variation. While earning her bachelor's degree from Northeastern University, she engaged in a variety of academic and industry research endeavors; these included skeletal stem cell development, high-throughput molecular biology for antibody discovery, and bio-distribution studies for antibodies engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier. The latter experience spurred her continuing interest in neurobiology.
