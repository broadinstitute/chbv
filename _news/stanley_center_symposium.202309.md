 Members of the Center presented a poster on their research goals, data generation and analysis methods, and plan for enhancing diverse perspectives (PEDP) at the biannual [Stanley Center Symposium]( https://www.broadinstitute.org/symposium/severe-mental-illness-towards-therapeutics). This year's symposium brought scientists working on the frontiers of genetics, neurobiology, computational psychiatry, and therapeutic development for neuropsychiatric disorders together. Presentations and discussions focused on how to turn genetic discoveries into better therapeutics for severe mental illnesses.
