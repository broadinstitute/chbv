 The Broad Institute recently highlighted the [Cell Annotation Service (CAS)](https://cellarium.ai/tool/cellarium-cell-annotation-service-cas/), a groundbreaking tool developed by [Mehrtash Babadi](/team/mehrtash_babadi/), a co-investigator at the Center for Human Brain Variation, and the Data Sciences Platform team. CAS uses advanced machine learning to accelerate single-cell annotation, transforming a time-intensive process into a rapid, efficient workflow. This feature showcases how CAS is making significant strides in single-cell research, enabling faster, more accurate identification of cell types and states.
