 Droplet-based single-cell assays generate systematic background noise with negative impacts, such as off-target gene expression in unexpected cell types and spurious differential expression results. To address this, [Stephen Fleming](/team/stephen_fleming/), [Mehrtash Babadi](/team/mehrtash_babadi/), and colleagues developed a deep generative model that distinguishes droplets containing cells from those without, learns the background noise profile, and retrieves uncontaminated counts from cell-containing droplets. They implemented the model in a scalable and robust open-source software package called [CellBender](https://github.com/broadinstitute/CellBender) and demonstrated the beneficial effects of denoising using simulated data and several real datasets. Read the full paper in [Nature Methods](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01943-7) and the research briefing [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-023-01946-4).
