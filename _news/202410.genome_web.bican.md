 [Kiku Ichihara](/team/kiku_ichihara/), Managing Director of the Center for Human Brain Variation, was recently featured in a GenomeWeb article covering the NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) program’s first major data release.

 The article highlights contributions from Ichihara and the Center for Human Brain Variation, which provided essential spatial and transcriptomic data from 20 human brains. The data release also includes extensive single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles from humans, mice, and other mammals contributed by BICAN groups.
