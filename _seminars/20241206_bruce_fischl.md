description: Dr. Fischl discussed technical advancements in deep learning applied to neuroimaging, particularly addressing the challenges posed by the domain gap, which affects the performance of algorithms trained on specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image types. To overcome this, his group has developed synthetic image synthesis techniques that enable networks to learn without bias from real MRI data, facilitating supervised learning in cases where manual annotation is challenging. He reviewed his results from a five-year project focused on creating tools for analyzing data across different scales, from micron-level microscopy to whole-brain MRI, aimed at constructing a detailed cellular and connectional atlas of the human brain.
