description: We will discuss how brain donation and postmortem research contributes to the advancing research on brain disorders and to combating the stigma associated with them. The seminar will cover the workflow at the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, factors impacting tissue performance, ongoing collaborative efforts to address BICAN project requirements and new approaches to research on postmortem human brain tissue. We will conclude by highlighting some of the projects in collaboration with Broad investigators. The talk will be followed by a 30-minute question and answer session.
