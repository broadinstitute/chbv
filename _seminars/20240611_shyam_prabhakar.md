description: A fundamental property of multicellular organisms is that cells in a tissue influence each other in stereotypical ways (a cell is defined by the company it keeps). We exploited this principle to develop BANKSY, a spatial clustering algorithm that uses a cellâ€™s neighborhood as a guide to its own identity. BANKSY also defines tissue domains and matches or outperforms all other tested methods on data from diverse FISH-, sequencing- and antibody-based SO technologies. Importantly, BANKSY is 10-1,000 times faster and 2-60 times more scalable than existing tools, and thus capable of analyzing datasets comprising >2M cells. Cell morphology is a neglected aspect of spatial omics data. We developed MEDOC, an algorithm that infers the latent space of morphological variation from segmented cells or nuclei. We applied MEDOC to MERFISH data from leukemic vs. healthy bone marrow and identified both shared and divergent molecular markers of cell morphology variation. These analyses show that biologically interpretable morphological phenotypes are apparent in spatial omics data. At the organismal scale, humans are shaped by a combination of intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) influences. To investigate these influences and characterize human diversity, we used single cell RNA-seq to profile 1,265,624 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 619 individuals from 7 population groups in 6 Asian countries. We uncovered profound molecular and cellular differences between these 7 groups, indicating that epidemiological studies may need fine-grained population descriptors. These included cell populations and genes implicated in disease risk and pathogenesis as well as those relevant for diagnostics. Remarkably, human variation in blood cell proportions correlated more strongly with genetic ancestry than with sex, thus making a case for including genetically diverse cohorts in population studies. More broadly, our results suggest that tailored diagnostic and therapeutic tests and strategies may be needed to fulfill the promise of Precision Medicine across the globe.
