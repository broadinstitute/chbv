## Motivation
The human brain is among the most complex biological objects known: more than 100 billion highly specialized cells, connected in specific ways, cooperate to engage in problem-solving, observation, empathy, insight, and direction of the human body. **To fully understand the brain’s function and vulnerabilities, we must learn about the biological diversity across people.**

An inventory of the human brain’s cellular components and their associated molecular repertoires – a cell atlas – will provide a powerfully enabling platform for translational neuroscience.

## Mission
The mission of the Center is to:
- **Create** an essential atlas of the profound variation in human brain biology using the latest single-cell and spatial omics technologies
- **Share** this data resource with the scientific and public communities
- To expand our understanding of the ways the human brain varies in both healthy and neurological conditions and **advance** psychiatric research
- **Engage** in outreach activities with a variety of organizations serving underrepresented groups.

## Research overview
The Center's research goals are to:
- Construct an atlas of human brain cell variation using a large, diverse set of brain donors
- Characterize the biological variation in the atlas
- Use the biological variation to reveal and understand brain function and dysfunction.

Please see our [research page](/chbv/research/) for more information.

## Who we are
We are based at the [Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).  Our interdisciplinary [team](/chbv/team/) of neuroscientists, human geneticists, computational biologists, and software engineers is led by [Steve McCarroll](/chbv/team/steve_mccarroll/), [Evan Macosko](/chbv/team/evan_macosko/), and [Kiku Ichihara](/chbv/team/kiku_ichihara/). The Center is funded by the [NIH BRAIN initiative](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/).

## Commitment to diversity, equity & inclusion
### In our research
Our atlas of human brain variation aims to capture the diversity of normal human brain biology in a suitably inclusive way. Our objective is to sample variation broadly, not to compare groups. A pitfall we must avoid is to appear to make (or to enable others to make) conclusions about any groups from what will likely be a small sample from a large, neurodiverse population.

We believe the point of including a diverse set of donors is not to compare groups, but rather to define the range of normal human brain biology in a suitably inclusive way. This ethic will be reflected in the analyses we do and the analyses we choose not to do.

### In our team
Our Center is committed to assembling a project team with diverse perspectives, while fostering an inclusive environment where all team members flourish.

### Our core values
- Inclusivity 
- Collaborative 
- Community 
- Integrity 
- Innovation 
- Exploration
