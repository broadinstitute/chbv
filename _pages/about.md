## Our mission
Human biology is a range, not a point measurement. The mission of the Center for Human Brain Cell Variation is to understand the cell-type-specific mechanisms and tissue-level biological principles that generate inter-individual variation in brain biology. We believe that inter-individual variation must be engaged while building a human cell atlas: variation allows us to go beyond descriptive catalogs to insights about how cell-type-specific biological processes fluctuate, co-fluctuate and accommodate one another, and how common genetic effects on brain vulnerability manifest in tissues. By addressing variation thoughtfully and purposefully, we hope to:

 - Create an appropriately broad and flexible definition of each cell type in a human cell atlas
 - Distinguish constant from dynamic features of each cell type
 - Relate cellular and molecular variation in brain tissue to abundant existing data on brain variation in living people, such as from structural imaging and human genetics
 - Understand how genetic variation acts through tissues to shape variation in human brain phenotypes, strengthening the interface between human genetics and neurobiology

In this work, we will leverage new technologies in single-cell and spatial genomics, including many developed in our labs, to construct an Atlas of Human Brain Cell Variation. By making molecular measurements of cell types across many people, in their spatial contexts, and including measurements across the course of postnatal development, our Atlas will simultaneously inform our understandings of:

 - The common, shared cellular features that make all of our brains work
 - The ways in which these features vary and co-vary across individuals
 - The relationship of this biological variation to genes, alleles and biological function
 - The tissue-based mechanisms of genetic risk for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders

## Who we are
The Center for Human Brain Variation is funded by the NIH BRAIN initiative. ...BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN). Primary objectives are:

 - To provide the research community with comprehensive reference brain cell atlases.
 - .....

We are based at the Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard. Our center is led by Steve McCarroll, Evan Macosko, and Kiku Ichihara.

 

Additional co-investigators include: 
 - Paola Arlotta
 - Mehrtash Babadi
 - Randy Buckner
 - Fei Chen
 - Elise Robinson
 - Charles Vanderburg
 - Joshua Welch
