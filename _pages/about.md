## Our mission
### Understanding variation in human brain biology
To create an atlas of the profound variation in human brain biology using the latest single-cell and spatial omics technologies, to share this resource with the scientific and public communities, and to expand our understanding of the ways the human brain varies in both healthy and neurological conditions.

## Research focus
### Inter-Individual Variation
As cell-census research moves from cell atlases of laboratory organisms to humans, our greatest challenge and opportunity involves inter-individual variation.
