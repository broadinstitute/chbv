## BICAN
The human brain is among the most complex biological objects known: more than 100 billion highly specialized cells, connected in specific ways, cooperate to engage in problem-solving, observation, empathy, insight, and direction of the human body. An inventory of the human brain’s cellular components and their associated molecular repertoires – a cell atlas – could provide a powerfully enabling platform for translational neuroscience. And yet, one of the most striking aspects of human experience involves variation in brain function: no two individuals think or behave in the same way. This diversity drives humanity’s creativity and resourcefulness; it also shapes each person’s vulnerability to neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, through tissue-resident mechanisms that are still unknown but critical to understand. To fully understand the brain’s function and vulnerabilities, we must know and be instructed by its biological diversity across people.

In this work, we will leverage new technologies in single-cell and spatial genomics, including many developed in our labs, to construct an Atlas of Human Brain Cell Variation. By making molecular measurements of cell types across many people, in their spatial contexts, and including measurements across the course of postnatal development, our Atlas will simultaneously inform our understandings of:

 - The common, shared cellular features that make all of our brains work
 - The ways in which these features vary and co-vary across individuals
 - The relationship of this biological variation to genes, alleles and biological function
 - The tissue-based mechanisms of genetic risk for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders

Beyond BICAN, our center will be applying the same approaches to the following neurological disease-focused projects:

 - Schizophrenia
 - Huntington's
 - Bipolar Amygdala
 - Simon's Aging Brain

## BICAN Research Aims
### Aim 1
Construct an integrative atlas of cell types within 50 major regions of the postnatal human brain from 64 donors (3,200 brain specimens) ages 10-25, with a focus on the later stages of development. We will analyze at least 30 million nuclei for this aim.

### Aim 2
Analyze tissue from 200 adults to uncover core patterns and principles of brain tissue variation. We will deeply study inter-individual variation by analyzing each of the 50 selected brain areas in samples of 200 people, analyzing at least 60 million nuclei from 10,000 brain specimens in total.

### Aim 3
Use human brain biological variation to reveal and understand biological functions. To realize the potential of such data to advance translational neuroscience, we will:

 - Use machine learning analysis to reveal how cells’ molecular features co-vary across cell types and individuals
 - Generate spatial transcriptomics data on 100 people to characterize how patterns of human brain cell-abundance and molecular variation manifest spatially within tissues
 - Explore how human genetic variation shapes the biology of brain tissue and of each of its cell types, uncovering the tissue manifestations of genetic vulnerability to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders

The successful completion of this work will deliver an essential data resource for cellular, molecular, genetic and translational neuroscience – while expanding our understanding of the ways the human brain varies from person to person and providing powerful new ways to learn from inter-individual variation in brain phenotypes.
