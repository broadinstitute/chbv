The Center for Human Brain Variation is committed to assembling a project team with a variety of perspectives, while fostering a welcoming environment where all team members flourish.  This is essential for a project in which the analysis of biological variation is a central theme.  Our Center aims to reach a wide community of scientists in a variety of different ways including:
- Provide elementary through undergraduate level students from surrounding communities with **resources** (such as mentoring, lab tours, educational materials) to get them excited about science and pursue careers in scientific research. 
- Create **opportunities for researchers** to join our team at many different career stages, from undergraduate students to mid-career scientists.  Please see our [jobs](/join-us) for more information about open positions.
- Host a quarterly **[seminar series](/seminar-series/)**, held in a hybrid format, with presentations from speakers at a variety of career stages with varied backgrounds and expertise.
