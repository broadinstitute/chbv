The Center for Human Brain Variation is committed to assembling a project team with diverse perspectives, while fostering an inclusive environment where all team members flourish.  This is essential for a project in which the analysis of biological variation and diversity is a central theme.  Our Center aims to reach a wide community of scientists in a variety of different ways including:
- Provide elementary through undergraduate level students from surrounding communities with **resources** (such as mentoring, lab tours, educational materials) to get them excited about science and pursue careers in scientific research. 
- Create **opportunities for researchers** to join our team at many different career stages, from undergraduate students to mid-career scientists.  In building our team, we aim to address the under-representation of groups in biomedical research in general, and at our institution in particular. Please see our [jobs page](/join-us) for more information about open positions.
- Establish a **Visiting Scientist Program** to increase the connectedness of the center with researchers at other geographic sites, institutions, and in other disciplines, with the majority of the Visiting Scientists coming from historically under-represented groups. To apply, please see our [job posting](/jobs/visiting_scientists_program).
- Host a quarterly **[seminar series](/seminar-series/)**, held in a hybrid format to increase accessibility, with presentations from speakers at a variety of career stages with diverse backgrounds and expertise.
